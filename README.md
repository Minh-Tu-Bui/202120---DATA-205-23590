## Capstone Project
The project focuses on the records of the police dispatched incidents in Montgomery County from 2017 to present. The main objectives are to conduct the forecast for the number of incidents using the time-series data, evaluate the responsiveness of the police stations in terms of travel distance to the incident locations, and recommend the optimal location of the current and new police stations. 

The main dataset is the “Police Dispatched Incidents” from dataMontgomery that provides relevant information about crime types, incident locations and police district numbers. The analysis uses the additional “Police Station” dataset to generate significant findings that support the ultimate objectives of the project. The main programming language in the report is Python with multiple packages and libraries and Tableau Public for mapping visualization.
